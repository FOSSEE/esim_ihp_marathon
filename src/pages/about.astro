  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-grey-800 mb-4 flex justify-center">Background and Motivation</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    The design and verification of integrated circuits (ICs) traditionally rely on expensive proprietary tools and closed foundry ecosystems. 
    This creates a barrier for students, researchers, and startups, particularly in developing regions, who wish to explore VLSI design.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    To address this challenge, <span class="font-bold">FOSSEE, IIT Bombay</span>, has developed 
    <span class="font-bold">eSim</span>, an open-source EDA tool that enables schematic design, simulation, and PCB development. 
    eSim is intended to democratize access to electronics design by offering a free and customizable alternative to commercial EDA tools.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    In parallel, <span class="font-bold">IHP Microelectronics, Germany</span>, has taken a pioneering step by releasing the 
    <span class="font-bold">SG13G2 PDK</span> under an open-source license. 
    This BiCMOS technology enables high-frequency analog, RF, and digital circuit design at the 130 nm nodeâ€”something previously accessible only through expensive, closed-access channels.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    By combining eSim with the IHP SG13G2 PDK, this marathon creates a rare opportunity for students, faculty, and enthusiasts to:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 space-y-2 mb-4">
    <li>Gain hands-on experience with a real-world PDK</li>
    <li>Design and simulate analog, digital, and mixed-signal circuits using only open tools</li>
    <li>Develop practical skills that align with industry and research requirements</li>
    <li>Contribute to the growing global movement for open-source silicon</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-800">
    The marathon fosters capacity-building in VLSI using open infrastructure, in line with national and global educational goals.
